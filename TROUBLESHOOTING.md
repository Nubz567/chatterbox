# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## ✅ SUCCESS: Minimal Deployment Working!

The minimal deployment with just Express was successful! This means the basic Vercel configuration is correct.

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Debugging

### ✅ Step 1: Minimal Deployment - SUCCESS
- Using `api/test-deploy.js` with only Express dependency
- Simplified `vercel.json` configuration
- Minimal `package.json`

### ✅ Step 2: dotenv - SUCCESS
- Environment variables working correctly
- No issues with .env configuration

### ✅ Step 3: mongoose - SUCCESS
- MongoDB connection working correctly
- Database integration successful

### ✅ Step 4: express-session - SUCCESS
- Session management working correctly
- Cookie configuration successful

### ✅ Step 5: socket.io - SUCCESS
- WebSocket configuration working correctly
- Real-time communication successful

### 🔄 Step 6: bcrypt - TESTING NOW
Currently testing with:
- ✅ Express (working)
- ✅ dotenv (working)
- ✅ mongoose (working)
- ✅ express-session (working)
- ✅ socket.io (working)
- 🔄 bcrypt (testing now)
- ⏳ Next: connect-mongo

### 📋 Dependency Testing Order
1. ✅ Express (working)
2. ✅ dotenv (working)
3. ✅ mongoose (working)
4. ✅ express-session (working)
5. ✅ socket.io (working)
6. 🔄 bcrypt (testing now)
7. ⏳ connect-mongo

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy current version** (with bcrypt)
2. **If successful**: Add connect-mongo next
3. **If failed**: We found the problematic dependency (bcrypt)
4. **Continue until all dependencies work**

### 📊 Test Results

Once deployed, test these endpoints:
- `/` - Should return deployment success message with bcrypt status
- `/health` - Should return status OK

### 🔍 What We're Looking For

The issue is likely one of these dependencies:
- **bcrypt** - Native dependency compilation issues ⚠️ TESTING NOW
- **connect-mongo** - MongoDB session store issues

**Please deploy this version and let me know if it succeeds!**
