# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Status
All recent deployments are failing with `X 0/1` status. Last successful deployment was "Chat problems fix 03".

## Step-by-Step Debugging

### 1. Test Minimal Deployment
- Using `api/test-deploy.js` with only Express dependency
- Simplified `vercel.json` configuration
- Minimal `package.json`

### 2. Check Vercel Build Logs
Go to your Vercel dashboard and check the build logs for the latest failed deployment. Look for:

- **Build errors**: Missing dependencies, syntax errors
- **Runtime errors**: Environment variable issues
- **Function errors**: Serverless function configuration problems

### 3. Common Issues to Check

#### A. Environment Variables
- `MONGODB_URI` - Is it set correctly in Vercel?
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Is it set?
- `NODE_ENV` - Should be "production"

#### B. Dependencies
- Are all dependencies compatible with Vercel?
- Any native dependencies that need compilation?

#### C. File Structure
- Is the `api/` folder structure correct?
- Are all required files present?

### 4. Next Steps

1. **Deploy this minimal version first**
2. **Check build logs for specific errors**
3. **Share the error messages from Vercel dashboard**
4. **Gradually add back functionality**

### 5. Test Commands

Once deployed, test these endpoints:
- `/` - Should return deployment success message
- `/health` - Should return status OK

## Error Messages to Look For

Common Vercel deployment errors:
- `Module not found`
- `Cannot find module`
- `Unexpected token`
- `Environment variable not found`
- `Function timeout`
- `Memory limit exceeded`

Please share the specific error messages from your Vercel build logs so we can fix them!
