# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## ✅ SUCCESS: Minimal Deployment Working!

The minimal deployment with just Express was successful! This means the basic Vercel configuration is correct.

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Debugging

### ✅ Step 1: Minimal Deployment - SUCCESS
- Using `api/test-deploy.js` with only Express dependency
- Simplified `vercel.json` configuration
- Minimal `package.json`

### ✅ Step 2: dotenv - SUCCESS
- Environment variables working correctly
- No issues with .env configuration

### 🔄 Step 3: mongoose - TESTING NOW
Currently testing with:
- ✅ Express (working)
- ✅ dotenv (working)
- 🔄 mongoose (testing now)
- ⏳ Next: express-session, socket.io, etc.

### 📋 Dependency Testing Order
1. ✅ Express (working)
2. ✅ dotenv (working)
3. 🔄 mongoose (testing now)
4. ⏳ express-session
5. ⏳ socket.io
6. ⏳ bcrypt
7. ⏳ connect-mongo

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy current version** (with mongoose)
2. **If successful**: Add express-session next
3. **If failed**: We found the problematic dependency (mongoose)
4. **Continue until all dependencies work**

### 📊 Test Results

Once deployed, test these endpoints:
- `/` - Should return deployment success message with database connection status
- `/health` - Should return status OK

### 🔍 What We're Looking For

The issue is likely one of these dependencies:
- **mongoose** - MongoDB connection issues ⚠️ TESTING NOW
- **socket.io** - WebSocket configuration problems
- **bcrypt** - Native dependency compilation issues
- **express-session** - Session configuration problems

**Please deploy this version and let me know if it succeeds!**
