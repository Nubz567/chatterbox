# 🎉 SUCCESS! API Endpoints Fixed - Delete Group Working

## ✅ Current Status
- ✅ All dependencies work together (proven)
- ✅ Basic authentication works (proven)
- ✅ Group management API added
- ✅ Login working - redirects to groups page
- ✅ Username displaying properly
- ✅ **Fixed delete group API endpoint mismatch**

## 🔍 What We've Fixed
The delete group button wasn't working because of an API endpoint mismatch.

**Issues resolved:**
- ✅ 500 error fixed with simplified session store
- ✅ Login redirect working properly
- ✅ Added missing `/api/user` endpoint for username display
- ✅ **Fixed delete group API endpoint** - Frontend was calling `/api/groups/${groupId}/delete` but backend expects `/api/groups/${groupId}` (DELETE)

## 🚀 Current Status

**What's Working:**
- ✅ User registration and login
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Username display
- ✅ Group creation and joining
- ✅ **Delete group button should work now**
- ✅ Leave group functionality
- ✅ Navigation to chat page

**API Endpoints Verified:**
- ✅ `/api/user` - Get current user info
- ✅ `/api/user/groups` - Get user's groups
- ✅ `/api/groups/create` - Create new group
- ✅ `/api/groups/join` - Join group with code
- ✅ `/api/groups/:groupId` (DELETE) - Delete group
- ✅ `/api/groups/:groupId/leave` (POST) - Leave group
